In this archive you can find an index.html file with provided page markup, images, some prepared scss files,
and a 'design' folder with expected results.
Your task is to generate two different css files (according to design) from a single _main.scss source file
by passing into it a different values for variables defined in _variables1.scss and _variables2.scss files.

Details:
There is a scss/style1.scss file which imports _main.scss and _variables1.scss partials. This file should be
compiled into css/style1.css file. The same is for scss/style2.scss, it shoud be compiled into css/style2.css
file. index.html by default shoud use style1.css for styling.

_main.scss file should contain all required css rules but some of css values should be taken from variables
which will be defined in _variables1.scss and _variables2.scss. Example:

_main.scss:

$contentBackground: null !default;

#content {
  width: 960px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background: $contentBackground;
}

...

_variables1.scss:

$contentBackground: #fff;

...

_variables2.scss:

$contentBackground: #660;

In case of using of koala-app for compiling you can find a koala-config.json config file where compilation
path is already set.

Expected results:
styles1.css and style2.css are generated from source files. Page desing should match desing1.jpg. Then page
is switched to use  styles2.css by changing link to <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style2.css"> then it
should match design2.css.
scss file should use a nesting syntax.
